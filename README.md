# IoT-Based Smart Lighting System

🚀 A simple and practical IoT project that controls a light using motion detection and a web interface. Built as part of my BSCS Semester 6 Internet of Things course.

## 🔧 Tools & Components
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- PIR Motion Sensor
- LED
- Wi-Fi Web Server (ESP8266WebServer)
